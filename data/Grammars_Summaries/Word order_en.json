"In linguistics, word order (also known as linear order) is the order of the syntactic constituents of a language. Word order typology studies it from a cross-linguistic perspective, and examines how different languages employ different orders. Correlations between orders found in different syntactic sub-domains are also of interest. The primary word orders that are of interest are\n\nthe constituent order of a clause, namely the relative order of subject, object, and verb;\nthe order of modifiers (adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, possessives, and adjuncts) in a noun phrase;\nthe order of adverbials.Some languages use relatively fixed word order, often relying on the order of constituents to convey grammatical information. Other languages\u2014often those that convey grammatical information through inflection\u2014allow more flexible word order, which can be used to encode pragmatic information, such as topicalisation or focus. However, even languages with flexible word order have a preferred or basic word order, with other word orders considered \"marked\".Constituent word order is defined in terms of a finite verb (V) in combination with two arguments, namely the subject (S), and object (O). Subject and object are here understood to be nouns, since pronouns often tend to display different word order properties. Thus, a transitive sentence has six logically possible basic word orders:\n\nabout half of the world's languages deploy subject\u2013object\u2013verb order (SOV);\nabout one-third of the world's languages deploy subject\u2013verb\u2013object order (SVO);\na smaller fraction of languages deploy verb\u2013subject\u2013object (VSO) order;\nthe remaining three arrangements are rarer: verb\u2013object\u2013subject (VOS) is slightly more common than object\u2013verb\u2013subject (OVS), and object\u2013subject\u2013verb (OSV) is the rarest by a significant margin."
